## Common Test Scenarios

### Valid Registration
```
Name: John Doe
Email: john@example.com
Password: securepass123
Confirm: securepass123
```
Expected: Redirect to dashboard, user created

### Invalid Registration
```
Name: (empty)
Email: invalid-email
Password: 123
Confirm: different
```
Expected: Validation errors displayed

### Valid Login
```
Email: john@example.com
Password: securepass123
```
Expected: Redirect to dashboard

### Invalid Login
```
Email: wrong@example.com
Password: wrongpass
```
Expected: Error message displayed

### Remember Me
- Check "Remember me" on login
- Close browser and reopen
- Visit the app - should still be logged in

## Troubleshooting Tests

### If Registration Fails
- Check database connection
- Verify migrations are run
- Check for validation errors

### If Login Fails
- Verify user was created
- Check password hashing
- Verify session configuration

### If Dashboard Not Accessible
- Check authentication middleware
- Verify route protection
- Check session configuration

### If Forms Don't Submit
- Check CSRF token inclusion
- Verify form method and action
- Check for JavaScript errors

## Performance Tests

### Page Load Times
- Landing page: Should load in < 2 seconds
- Login/Register: Should load in < 1 second
- Dashboard: Should load in < 1.5 seconds

### Responsive Design
- Test on mobile devices
- Test on tablets
- Test on desktop
- Verify all elements are properly sized

### Browser Compatibility
- Test on Chrome
- Test on Firefox
- Test on Safari
- Test on Edge

## Security Tests

### CSRF Protection
- Try submitting forms without CSRF token
- Should receive 419 error or redirect

### Session Security
- Check session regeneration on login
- Verify session invalidation on logout

### Route Protection
- Try accessing protected routes as guest
- Should redirect to login

### Input Validation
- Test SQL injection attempts
- Test XSS attempts
- Test file upload vulnerabilities

## Success Criteria

The authentication system is working correctly when:

1. ✅ Users can register new accounts
2. ✅ Users can log in with valid credentials
3. ✅ Users can access protected dashboard
4. ✅ Users can log out successfully
5. ✅ Guest users are redirected from protected routes
6. ✅ Forms display validation errors properly
7. ✅ CSRF protection is active
8. ✅ Sessions are managed securely
9. ✅ UI is responsive and beautiful
10. ✅ All routes work as expected

## Next Steps

After successful testing:

1. **Customize the UI** - Modify colors, fonts, and layout
2. **Add Features** - Implement user profiles, settings, etc.
3. **Enhance Security** - Add email verification, 2FA, etc.
4. **Deploy** - Move to production environment
5. **Monitor** - Set up logging and error tracking
